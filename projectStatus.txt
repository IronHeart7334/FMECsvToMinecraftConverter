This document will be revised as people are added to the project.

Project Goal:
    Convert Aerospace museum into Minecraft.

    Convert 3-dimensional data of the American River College into Minecraft,
    allowing students to take a virtual tour of the campus,
    and implement the Wayfinding project into the Minecraft world so students can find their way around campus.

    Use Minecraft as a collaborative design space.

Steps to complete:
    [/] Convert CSV [x, y, z] file to Minecraft.
    [] Convert CSV [x, y, z, r, g, b] to Minecraft.
    [?] Convert other file formats to CSV [x, y, z, r, g, b] which can then be converted to Minecraft.
     \_(Which formats do we want?)
    [] Add more user-friendly method of converting files to Minecraft.
     \_(Matt proposes a script which features a GUI asking for a file,
        which then feeds the file into the appropriate (FILE_TYPE)->(CSV) converter,
        and then the (CSV)->(MC) converter.)
    [] Implement interpolation into (CSV)->(MC) conversion to fill in gaps in the data.
     \_(Current method leaves holes in the ground of the resulting world,
        so we will likely need a custom algorithm for this. Matt has an idea for how we can do this)
    [% Matt Crow] Scale everything appropriately (1 Minecraft block is one cubic meter)
     \_(this means the (FILE_TYPE)->(CSV) converters should scale their input to meters,
        so we will need to know the measurements their input is in.
        Matt just needs to verify each converter is outputting in meters)
    [] Set up a Minecraft server to host the converted ARC campus.
    [] Have a group of people manipulate the ARC campus Minecraft world to make corrections.
    [] Convert the ARC campus Minecraft world back into CSV or other formats to save the more accurate
       (albeit more cubic) data for other projects.
    [] Implement Wayfinding into the ARC campus Minecraft world.
     \_(Will add more steps for this once we have progressed further in the project)
